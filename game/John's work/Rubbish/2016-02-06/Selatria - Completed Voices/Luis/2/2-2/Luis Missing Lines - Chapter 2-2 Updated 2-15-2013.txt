Hey River, here are some notes on missing lines for Chapter 2-2. I think it may have come from a mix of me updating them since I thought you haven't recorded them, and then realizing they haven't been uploaded yet.

I do like the Luis scream so I'm going to try and fit it in! However, these lines are still missing!



012 - "Did he now?" should be changed to "Did she now?"

Missing Dialogue and Context:

----------------------------

Luis: Mage, let's see if we can try one of these houses. The people there might have something they can tell us.

----------------------------

[Luis enters and looks around]

Luis: An infirmary? Looks more like a prison...

----------------------------

Luis: These whippersnappers are on the run and are trying to get some assistance from neighboring towns. 

----------------------------

Mage: Are you sure this time?

Luis: Boy! Don't question me! I know my friend's house when I see it!


[At the house]

Luis: *knock knock* Morgen! You there buddy? It's Luis!

Resident: What's the password?

Mage: Bluero-

Luis: Are you going deaf in the ear!? I said my name is Luis!

Resident: Go away! Dakk'rian scum! We don't know anyone named Luis!

Luis: *Bang Bang Bang* Does Morgen ring a bell?

Resident: ...

Luis: Fine, fine. I see what you're getting at! Wanting to play that stupid password game are you?

Luis: What was it... 

Mage: It's blue- 

Luis: Shut up, Mage. I got this. It was a blue...

Mage: Ros...

Luis [Interrupting]: BlueRose! I remember now! Ha. In your face! BlueRose! Now where's Morgen?

Resident: She doesn't live here anymore! Now go away!

Melanie: Wow... what a waste of time. 

Luis: Waste of time? What a waste of a cutscene. What is this, a filler chapter? I'm going to sue! 

Mage: Yeah... let's head back, we're not making much progress.
